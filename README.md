# Pretty Object #

Pretty Object is an object pretty-printer for handling Golden Master test output. Pretty Object, out of the box, will print all accessible fields in an object as a new-line delimited output. You can also provide transformations for any field values which either should be ignored, or might need to be modified, such as DateTime comparisons.
